# EEIRS Receipt Tracking Project - Group 14 - Spring 2025
## Project Goals
- The goals of this project are to build and present a website that a hypothetical employer would be able to use to gather company expense information from employees by having them securely login to a website, upload photos of their recipts, and verify the recipt information before uploading said receipt to a database.
- The project will also feature a way for an employer to login and view the company's expenses and provide tools that they can use to monitor the company's expense history so they may be able to better manage their spending.
## Project Deadlines
### Febuary 16th, 2025 - **System Prototype**
- This deadline requires us to have a functioning prototype that authenticates users and allow them to upload receipt data through the website. It should also allow for employers to see the month to month spending of their company.
